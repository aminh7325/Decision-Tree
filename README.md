# Decision-Tree
I implemented a decision tree in this project without using any ready-in advance library. After running the code, it will give you created decision tree in a pdf.

I had two datasets. One is a simple one. The results of this example are like below:

The other example has more data and a big decision tree, but in this example, accuracy is 79% on the training dataset and 77% on the test dataset. ( No overfitting ;) )
